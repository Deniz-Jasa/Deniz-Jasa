### Hey folks ðŸ¤ 

My name is Deniz Jasarbasic, and Iâ€™m an undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa with a key passion for full-stack, design, and product engineering.

Iâ€™m currently co-leading the brilliant team at [uOttaHack](https://uottahack.ca/); our mission is to empower students to comfortably explore tech outside the classroom.

Feel free to connect with me! I love learning and chatting with new people. 

Check out my website below â€” it's my small mark on the worldwide internet :)

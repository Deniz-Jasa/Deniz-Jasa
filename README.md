### Hi ðŸ¤ 

My name is Deniz Jasarbasic, and Iâ€™m an undergrad student studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. I'm really passionate about product engineering, design, and machine learning!

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at IBM, where I'm researching phishing detection using ML, static, and dynamic analysis methods. Iâ€™ve also been learning about parallel programming and utilizing GPUs and ARM hardware to speed up LLMs.

In my free time, I like to help organize a student-led hackathon called [uOttaHack](https://uottahack.ca/), work on personal projects, and travel (I recently backpacked Croatia, Spain, and France)!

Feel free to connect me with and also check out my website below â€” it's my small mark on the worldwide internet :)

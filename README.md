### Hi 🤠

I’m Deniz! I’m currently a Software Engineer at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/). I first started as an intern last summer and got really into observability and performance work. If you're also interested in that type of eng work, here's a small [blog/preview about the types of problems](https://jkeuhlen.com/2025/08/04/Silly-Computations.html) we solved at Mercury.

Recently in the Fall I was an exchange student at Sorbonne Université in Paris, where I took graduate courses in ML, quantum physics, and bioinformatics (I'm planning to post a few of the projects I worked on here soon). I also maximized the rest of my time traveling, meeting new people, and improving my French :) If you're passionate about any of this, hit me up, I love talking about it.

I’m also a huge advocate of hackathons. A few years ago, I helped restart and lead my university’s hackathon, uOttaHack, which pushed me to grow a lot as an engineer, builder, and aspiring founder. I wrote a [short blog post](https://denizjasarbasic.com/04052025--building-a-hackathon-community) about that experience!

Feel free to connect, and take a look at my website and GitHub below. It’s my small contribution to the internet :)

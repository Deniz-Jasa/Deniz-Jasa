### Hi ðŸ¤ 

My name is Deniz Jasarbasic, and Iâ€™m an undergrad student studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. I've really passionate about product engineering, design, and machine learning!

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at [IBM's Center for Advanced Studies](https://casweb.59b0587b.public.multi-containers.ibm.com/ibm/cas/canada/), where I'm researching web threat detection using ML, static, and dynamic analysis methods. In my free time, I like to help organize [uOttaHack](https://uottahack.ca/), work on personal projects, and travel!

Feel free to connect me with and also check out my website below â€” it's my small mark on the worldwide internet :)

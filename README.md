### Hi ðŸ¤ 

My name is Deniz Jasarbasic, and Iâ€™m an undergrad student studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. I've really been enjoying full-stack, design, and product engineering.

I'm currently an Undergraduate Research Fellow at [IBM's Center for Advanced Studies](https://casweb.59b0587b.public.multi-containers.ibm.com/ibm/cas/canada/), where I'm researching cybersecurity threat detection. On the side, I'm advise the amazing team of student organizers at [uOttaHack](https://uottahack.ca/), which I helped relaunch and scale into Canadaâ€™s second-largest hackathon. Our mission being empowering students to comfortably explore tech beyond the classroom.

Feel free to connect with me as well! I love learning and chatting with new people.

Check out my website below â€” it's my small mark on the worldwide internet :)
